I decided to write the steps I took


Task 1: Download from \Home Works subfolder of the course Moodle site the worksheet 
Hist_HSV.xlsx, and enter in B1 cell of Hue worksheet the computed starting index from Task 0.  
Create separate grayscale duplicates of each of the indicated on the Hist_Hue worksheet *.jpg 
files based on the hue, saturation and brightness values normalized from 0 to 255. Use Image  Type 
 HSB Stack command. Save the produced grayscale image stacks in *.png format using 0 digit in 
the file name for the hue image, 1 – saturation, and 2 – brightness. Upload the images in respective 
subfolders \HW1\hue\, \HW1\sat\ and \HW1\val\. 


- File -> Import -> Image Sequence 
- Choose the folder (Nare_nonzip_original) that consists of 112 images (8*14)
-Filter (-11|-13|-14)
- Image -> Type -> HSB Stack 

Now I have 2 moving scales. One has three states: hue, saturation, brightness/value. The second one has 72 (8*3*3) states for each of my images.

- File -> Save As -> Image Sequence
- Choose a folder where I want to keep those HSB images (all_c001_c002_c003)

Here we have red blue and green versions of the hue saturation and brightness

- File -> Import -> Image Sequence 

- Choose the folder where I saved previous 72 images (all_c001_c002_c003)
- Filter for hue c001, for saturation c002, for brightness c003
- Image -> Type -> 8-bit
- File -> Save As -> Image Sequence
- Choose the folder where I want to save new_hue, new_sat, new_bright images
