I decided to write the steps I took


Task 1: Download from \Home Works subfolder of the course Moodle site the worksheet 
Hist_HSV.xlsx, and enter in B1 cell of Hue worksheet the computed starting index from Task 0.  
Create separate grayscale duplicates of each of the indicated on the Hist_Hue worksheet *.jpg 
files based on the hue, saturation and brightness values normalized from 0 to 255. Use Image  Type 
 HSB Stack command. Save the produced grayscale image stacks in *.png format using 0 digit in 
the file name for the hue image, 1 – saturation, and 2 – brightness. Upload the images in respective 
subfolders \HW1\hue\, \HW1\sat\ and \HW1\val\. 


- File -> Import -> Image Sequence 
- Choose the folder (Nare_nonzip_original) that consists of 112 images (8*14)
-Filter (-11|-13|-14)
- Image -> Type -> HSB Stack 

Now I have 2 moving scales. One has three states: hue, saturation, brightness/value. The second one has 72 (8*3*3) states for each of my images.

- File -> Save As -> Image Sequence
- Choose a folder where I want to keep those HSB images (all_c001_c002_c003)

Here we have red blue and green versions of the hue saturation and brightness

- File -> Import -> Image Sequence 

- Choose the folder where I saved previous 72 images (all_c001_c002_c003)
- Filter for hue c001, for saturation c002, for brightness c003
- Image -> Type -> 8-bit
- File -> Save As -> Image Sequence
- Choose the folder where I want to save new_hue, new_sat, new_bright images


I'll try to complete Task 2 and Task 3 simultaneosly.

Task 2: Compute the histograms of all grayscale images created in Task 1 and fill in the tables in Hist_Hue, His_Sat and Hist_Val worksheets of the Hist_HSV.xlsx worksheet. You are welcome to use Analyze  Histogram command. The cumulative histograms will be automatically computed in Cum_Hue, Cum_Sat and Cum_Val worksheets respectively. 

Task 3: Using the computed histograms, estimate the minimal and maximal threshold values of hue, saturation and brightness for each image as to optimally extract the facial pixels. Fill in the range B260:Z261 in Hist_Hue, His_Sat and Hist_Val worksheets respectively. You are welcome to use Image  Adjust  Color Threshold command (specify HSB color space). 

For Task 2, I opened each image (1. hue 2. sat 3. bright), then  open histogram and copy the list's count column to my Hist_Hue, Hist_Sat, Hist_Val columns.

For Task 3, steps included in the task didn't work, so
I opened each image (1. hue 2. sat 3. bright), then open histogram, selected face part using oval, looked at min max values and copied them in B260:Z261.
