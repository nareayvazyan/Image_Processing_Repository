Task 1: 

- File -> Import -> Image Sequence 
- Choose the folder (Nare_nonzip_original) that consists of 112 images (8*14)
-Filter (-11|-13|-14)
- Image -> Type -> HSB Stack 

Now I have 2 moving scales. One has three states: hue, saturation, brightness/value. The second one has 72 (8*3*3) states for each of my images.

- File -> Save As -> Image Sequence
- Choose a folder where I want to keep those HSB images (all_c001_c002_c003)

Here we have red blue and green versions of the hue saturation and brightness

- File -> Import -> Image Sequence 

- Choose the folder where I saved previous 72 images (all_c001_c002_c003)
- Filter for hue c001, for saturation c002, for brightness c003
- Image -> Type -> 8-bit
- File -> Save As -> Image Sequence
- Choose the folder where I want to save new_hue, new_sat, new_bright images

I'll try to complete Task 2 and Task 3 simultaneosly.

For Task 2, I opened each image (1. hue 2. sat 3. bright), then  open histogram and copy the list's count column to my Hist_Hue, Hist_Sat, Hist_Val columns.

For Task 3, steps included in the task didn't work, so
I opened each image (1. hue 2. sat 3. bright), then open histogram, selected face part using oval, looked at min max values and copied them in B260:Z261.  (discussed during PSS with TA)
Initilly this was giving almost the same results for all images so I decided to apply another method.
Image -> Adjust -> Threshold -> Adjust scales so that the facial part is selected.
Both are written in my Excel sheets.
