What my macro does..

The macro processes the sequence of images specified for me:

Opens the image sequence from the specified directory.
Applies Gaussian blur and median filter to reduce noise.
Uses plugin given to us to apply HSV thresholding.
Converts the image to binary and inverts it.
Creates an oval selection and inverts it.
Clears the inverted selection, effectively keeping the oval region and setting the rest to black.
Saves the processed images as PNG files in the specified directory.
